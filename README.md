# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction

In order to complete the acceptance criteria, we must accomplish the following:

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## APIs

We were given starter code to begin the project. I deleted the past, present, and future classes seeing that our JS would dynamically change those due to the specific time. I also noticed that I had to reference a clock in order for the background colors to change. Without them, the description class defaulted the colors to yellow green.

## Functions and Setting Variables
 
Similar to the to another repo, I struggled with finding the correct variables. I researched other codes similar to my project and reference them within my js. I had to reverse engineer and use console.log to understand exactly how my code was responding in the DevTools.


## Misc
  
Comments were added for clarity. I also added some spacing for legibility purposes.

## Lessons Learned

PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE & RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH. REPEAT. JS is not going anywhere.
